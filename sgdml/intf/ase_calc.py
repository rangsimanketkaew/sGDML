        ASE calculator for the sGDML force field.

        A calculator takes atomic numbers and atomic positions from an Atoms object and calculates the energy and forces.

        Note
        ----
        ASE uses eV and Angstrom as energy and length unit, respectively. Unless the paramerters `E_to_eV` and `F_to_eV_Ang` are specified, the sGDML model is assumed to use kcal/mol and Angstorm and the appropriate conversion factors are set accordingly.
        Here is how to find them: `ASE units <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/units.html>`_.

        Parameters
        ----------
                model_path : :obj:`str`
                        Path to a sGDML model file
                E_to_eV : float, optional
                        Conversion factor from whatever energy unit is used by the model to eV. By default this parameter is set to convert from kcal/mol.
                F_to_eV_Ang : float, optional
                        Conversion factor from whatever length unit is used by the model to Angstrom. By default, the length unit is not converted.
